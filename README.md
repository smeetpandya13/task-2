In this project, I analyzed a sample phishing email to identify common signs of phishing. I examined the senderâ€™s email for spoofing, checked the email headers for inconsistencies using an online analyzer, and reviewed the content for suspicious links, attachments, and urgent or threatening language. I also looked for mismatched URLs and grammar or spelling errors. Based on this analysis, I summarized the key phishing indicators found in the email.
